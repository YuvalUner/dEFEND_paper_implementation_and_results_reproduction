This repository contains an implementation for the deep learning model described in ["dEFEND: Explainable Fake News Detection"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330935) 
by Kai Shu et al. (2019).\
\
The model is implemented in PyTorch and was trained (in the original paper) on the [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet) dataset.\
Due to issues accessing the comments of the dataset, we provide here a modified version with comments generated using AI.\
\
Please refer to the provided Jupyter notebook for a demonstration of the model.\
Please refer to the original paper for more details on the model and the dataset.

abstract = {In recent years, to mitigate the problem of fake news, computational detection of fake news has been studied, producing some promising early results. While important, however, we argue that a critical missing piece of the study be the explainability of such detection, i.e., why a particular piece of news is detected as fake. In this paper, therefore, we study the explainable detection of fake news. We develop a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network to exploit both news contents and user comments to jointly capture explainable top-k check-worthy sentences and user comments for fake news detection. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by at least 5.33\% in F1-score, but also (concurrently) identifies top-k user comments that explain why a news piece is fake, better than baselines by 28.2\% in NDCG and 30.7\% in Precision.},
